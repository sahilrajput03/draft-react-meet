##Lifecycle

###Mounting

These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

    constructor()
    static getDerivedStateFromProps()
    render()
    componentDidMount()
    
###Updating

An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered:

    static getDerivedStateFromProps()
    shouldComponentUpdate()
    render()
    getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
    componentDidUpdate()


###Unmounting

This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

    componentWillUnmount()

###Error Handling

These methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.

    static getDerivedStateFromError()
    componentDidCatch()

###Other APIs

Each component also provides some other APIs:

    setState()
    forceUpdate()
